# Phase 1, Mission 2: Scientific Computing in Python

This section is dedicated to mastering the core scientific libraries in Python: NumPy and Matplotlib.

## First Project: 1D Heat Equation Simulation

**Objective:**

To simulate the 1D heat equation using the Finite Difference method from scratch, to build a strong foundation in NumPy for array manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization and animation.
